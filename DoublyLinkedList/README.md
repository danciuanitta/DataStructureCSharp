# Doubly-Linked List
A linear collection of items stored dynamically, where each element of list (called *node*) contains the *value* to be stored, a refference to the *previous* element of the list and a refference to the *next* element of the list.

The first element is called *head*, having previous set to null.
The last one is called *tail*, having the next set to null.
